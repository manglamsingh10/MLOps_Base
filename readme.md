## Description

This project aims to build a comprehensive MLOps pipeline that integrates various tools and technologies to streamline the machine learning lifecycle. The pipeline includes the following key components:

1. **Optuna**: An optimization framework to automate hyperparameter tuning.
2. **MLflow**: A platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.
3. **DVC (Data Version Control)**: A version control system for data and machine learning models.
4. **Flask**: A micro web framework to expose the prediction API.
5. **Docker**: Containerization to ensure consistency across different environments.
6. **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: A managed Kubernetes service for deploying and managing containerized applications.
7. **Kubernetes**: An orchestration tool to manage containerized applications.
8. **Helm**: A package manager for Kubernetes to manage deployments.

The project workflow involves creating a simple machine learning model, optimizing it using Optuna, tracking experiments with MLflow, versioning data and models with DVC, and finally deploying the model as a Flask API. The entire application is containerized using Docker and deployed to GKE using Kubernetes and Helm charts for efficient management and scaling.

This project serves as a practical example of implementing MLOps practices to ensure reproducibility, scalability, and efficient management of machine learning projects.
